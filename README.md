# Mongoose

This project is a basic Node.js Mongoose API server connecting to MongoDB hosted in Atlas.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/api`. Nodemon is watching files and the app will automatically recompile if you change any of the source files.
